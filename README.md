# ATM Console Application

This C++ project simulates an ATM interface, allowing users to interact with their bank account via a console application. It's designed to showcase foundational programming skills and concepts, making it an excellent example of practical C++ application for beginners and intermediate developers alike.

## Skills and Concepts Showcased

### Control Structures
- **Conditional Statements (`if` and `switch`)**: Utilized to determine the flow of execution based on the user's choices, such as checking balances, depositing, or withdrawing funds.
- **Loops (`do-while`)**: Keeps the application running, presenting the menu until the user decides to exit. This demonstrates how to effectively use loops to repeat actions within software.

### Fundamental C++ Syntax
- Basic input/output with `std::cin` and `std::cout`: Engages with the user, gathering input and providing feedback, which is central to interactive console applications.
- Variable declarations and manipulations: Demonstrates the use of variables to store and update the account balance, a key concept in any programming task.

### Functions
- The `showMenu()` function: Separates the menu display logic from the main application flow, illustrating the importance of modular code for maintainability and readability.

### Error Handling
- Basic input validation: Ensures that the application behaves correctly (e.g., preventing withdrawals that exceed the current balance), introducing the concept of error handling and user input validation.

## Compilation and Execution

Ensure you have a C++ compiler like GCC, Clang, or MSVC. Compile with
